class IDCATRDFHarvester(Interface):

    def before_download(self, url, harvest_job):
        '''
        Called just before the remote RDF file is downloaded

        It returns a tuple with the url (which can be modified) and an
        optional list of error messages.

        If the url value evaluates to False the gather stage will be stop.

        This extension point can be useful to validate the URL using an
        external service.

        :type url: string
        :param harvest_job: A ``HarvestJob`` domain object which contains a

                            (``harvest_job.source``).
        :type harvest_job: object


        :returns: A tuple with two items:
                    * The url. If this is False the gather stage will stop.
                    * A list of error messages. These will get stored as gather
                      errors by the harvester

        optional list of error messages.

        If the content value evaluates to False the gather stage will stop.
